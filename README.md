## Install

Clone this repository(or just download and move it) to some specific folder in your server (`webcomposer` folder, for example).

Access in the browser: `http://example.com/webcomposer/index.php`.

Provide user and password ( admin / w3bC0mp053R )

You should change the password of your file in the first lines of the index.php.

The script should download and install a local composer (This only happen once, be patience).

Wait for "Ready. All commands are available".

Right now, you can start typing your composer commands. Try `help`.


## Warning
